Forensic facial reconstruction is crucial for identifying human remains in a medico-legal
context, but the variability in facial soft tissue thickness due to demographic factors such as age, sex,
and body mass index persists as an open problem. This study utilizes high-resolution DICOM and
NRRD data to accurately measure FSTT at craniofacial landmarks, examining a sample of 57 patients
(36 males, 21 females). The segmentation and mesh filtering process facilitated precise measurements.
Statistical analysis using Pearson correlation coefficient and ANCOVA, along with Machine Learning
models like Random Forest and Decision Trees, confirmed that BMI significantly influences FSTT.
Specifically, higher BMI was found to correlate with increased FSTT, particularly in the mid-philtrum
regions. Age and sex showed a lesser but still significant impact. These results confirm the importance
of considering individual demographic characteristics to improve the accuracy of FFRs. This rigorous
methodological approach ensures reliable and applicable results in both forensic and medical contexts,
proposing a significant improvement in facial reconstruction techniques based on detailed FSTT
analysis.
