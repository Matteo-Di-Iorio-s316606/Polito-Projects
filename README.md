This portfolio collects a selection of projects developed during my Masterâ€™s Degree in Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Torino. 
The projects span different areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence, aiming to demonstrate both technical skills and the ability to apply data-driven approaches to real-world problems.

Depending on the requirements of each course, the projects may include code, reports, and/or experimental results. 

Together, these works reflect a progressive learning path and a broad interest in machine learning applications.
